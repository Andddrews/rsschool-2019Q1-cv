          ##Summary

              Now I am a lecturer at the Institute for Advanced Studies. As a person who has a academic degree and title, I am used to mental work and I know what technical creativity is. I think programming is very close to what I did before.
               
                   I am successful at my current job. But my work has become uninteresting to me.
                I have never liked solving crossword puzzles, but Java Script tasks solving makes me happy. 
               
            
                Now it’s rather hard to work not in IT and learn IT.
                If I were a junior programmer, I would learn Java Script faster. My academic degree and title support my ability to set goals and achieve them on my own.

         ##Expirience 
           
               I haven't had any experience as a programmer befor, but I'm full of enthusiasm to start my career right now. 
     
          ##Education
          
              I’ve graduated from the Polatsk State University as a civil engineer.
            Than I was postgraduate student. 
            In 2003 I received the degree of Candidate of Technical Sciences in Belarusian National Technical University
            then the rank of assistant professor.
       
          ##English level
            
              As a student, I additionally studied English. Classes were held on the textbook Headway.
            At the end of study I learned the upper intermediate level. Updating English knowledge is easier than getting it.
            Now my level is intermediate.
        
            It is hard to understand native speakers, you know.
