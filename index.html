            <p>
              Now I am a lecturer at the Institute for Advanced Studies. As a person who has a academic degree and title, I am used to mental work and I know what technical creativity is. I think programming is very close to what I did before. <br />
            </p> 
            <p> 
              I am successful at my current job. But my work has become uninteresting to me.
              I have never liked solving crossword puzzles, but Java Script tasks solving makes me happy. <br />
            </p> 
            <p> 
                Now it’s rather hard to work not in IT and learn IT.
                If I were a junior programmer, I would learn Java Script faster. My academic degree and title support my ability to set goals and achieve them on my own.

           <p>
            I haven't had any experience as a programmer befor, but I'm full of enthusiasm to start my career right now.

          <h2>Education</h2>
            <p> 
              I’ve graduated from the Polatsk State University as a civil engineer.
            Than I was postgraduate student. 
            In 2003 I received the degree of Candidate of Technical Sciences in Belarusian National Technical University
            then the rank of assistant professor.

      <div id="English level">
          <h2>English level</h2>
            <p> 
              As a student, I additionally studied English. Classes were held on the textbook Headway.
            At the end of study I learned the upper intermediate level. Updating English knowledge is easier than getting it.
            Now my level is intermediate. I have been reading the Third Edition of "Object-Oriented JavaScript" by Ved Antani and Stoyan Stefanov this year. (https://javascript.info/) is easy to read for me too.<br />

            It is hard to understand native speakers, you know.
